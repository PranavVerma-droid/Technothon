Circuit Connections
Components Required:
Arduino Uno
BTS7960 Motor Driver Module (can handle two motors, so youâ€™ll need two modules for four 775 motors)
HM-10 Bluetooth Module
Four 775 Motors
12V LiPo Battery
Wiring Diagram:
Power Supply:

Connect the positive terminal of the 12V LiPo battery to the +12V terminal on both BTS7960 modules.
Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the GND terminal on both BTS7960 modules.
Arduino to BTS7960 Motor Driver (Right Motor):

RPWM (Right motor forward) pin on BTS7960 -> Arduino pin 5
LPWM (Right motor reverse) pin on BTS7960 -> Arduino pin 6
+5V and GND on the BTS7960 -> +5V and GND on the Arduino (for logic level).
Arduino to BTS7960 Motor Driver (Left Motor):

RPWM (Left motor forward) pin on BTS7960 -> Arduino pin 9
LPWM (Left motor reverse) pin on BTS7960 -> Arduino pin 10
+5V and GND on the BTS7960 -> +5V and GND on the Arduino (for logic level).
Bluetooth Module (HM-10):

TX (Bluetooth) -> RX (Arduino) (usually pin 3, depending on software serial setup)
RX (Bluetooth) -> TX (Arduino) (usually pin 2)
VCC -> 5V on Arduino
GND -> GND on Arduino
Motor Connections:

Connect each 775 motor to the M+ and M- terminals on the BTS7960 modules. Connect two motors on each BTS7960 module to drive all four wheels.
